### Hi there 👋

I like to make cool things, collaborate on interesting projects like 🦂, and creating environments for learning and growth.

* 🔭 I’m currently working on scorpion.io and making cool things for American Airlines Inc.
* 🌱 I’m currently learning React, GraphQL, and how to build API's at scale.
* 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on making apps, data analytics, security research, and creating better learning environments.
* 🤔 I’m looking for help with various parts of the scorpion.io project.
* 💬 Ask me about security, coding, business, collaboration, learning journeys, and teamwork.
* 📫 How to reach me: brett@scorpion.io
* ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that scorpions can consume large amounts of food in one sitting? They have an efficient food storage organ and a very low metabolic rate, and a relatively `inactive lifestyle` . Just like me...
* 🍵 [Tea, Earl Grey, hot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3103).
