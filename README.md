### Namaste 🖖

I like to make cool things ( [✈️](https://jobs.aa.com) [🦂](https://scorpion.io) [🍵](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3103) ), collaborate on interesting projects, and creating environments for learning opportunities and growth.

* 🔭 - I’m currently working on [scorpion.io](https://scorpion.io) and projects for [American Airlines, Inc](https://jobs.aa.com).
* 🌱 - I’m learning [React](https://reactjs.org), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Backstage](https://backstage.io), [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de), and how to build robust enterprise level API's at scale.
* 👯 - I’m looking to collaborate on app development, data analytics, security, research, and making enjoyable learning environments.
* 🤔 - I’m looking for help with various parts of the [scorpion](https://github.com/scorpion/scorpion/issues) project.
* 💬 - Ask me about security, coding, business, collaboration, learning journeys, teamwork, ethics, and philosophy.
* 📫 - How to reach me: brett@scorpion.io.
* ⚡ - Fun fact: Did you know that [scorpions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpion) can consume large amounts of food in one sitting? They have an efficient food storage organ and a very low metabolic rate, and a relatively `inactive lifestyle` . Just like me...
* 🍵 - [Tea, Earl Grey, hot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3103).
* 🍪 - Works extra hard when presented with cookies as a reward.
